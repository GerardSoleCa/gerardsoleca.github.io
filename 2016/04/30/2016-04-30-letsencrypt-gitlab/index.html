<p>The guys from GitLab integrated GitLab CI on their Software Repository on v8.7, so we decided to integrate it to our
release cycle.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been working with it for several months, and new I would like to share some experiences with it taking in mind that
I was working with Jenkins for our software deployments.</p>

<p>I was decided to introduce it to the company due to my great experience with Travis when using GitHub repositories, and due to
the lack of easiness for Jenkins to configure the jobs from the repository itself.</p>
