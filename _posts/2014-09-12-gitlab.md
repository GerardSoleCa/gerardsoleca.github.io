Once upon a time I started a new personal project. GitHub is far the best solution for open-source projects, but is far away from being a cheap solution to private needs. After a deep search on the net I found [BitBucket](https://www.bitbucket.org){:target="_blank"} a solution from Atlassian.

This is a really good solution for personal and small teams projects, it offers unlimited private repost for up to 5 members on a team, enough for *small* teams. Simultaneously to BitBucket I found another solution, [GitLab](http://gitlab.org){:target="_blank"}. GitLab is open-source and is offered to the community to be deployed behind a firewall. I've installed on a Intel Atom dedicated server in OVH and the speed is amazing taking into account the hardware where it has been deployed.

It's really easy to install, setup and run. Go to [GitLab Downloads](https://about.gitlab.com/downloads/){:target="_blank"} and look how 5 much commands do for you!
