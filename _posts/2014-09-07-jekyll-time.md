The worst thing on one dev's life is to mess around a blog systems. Most of them are powerful but not fully functional. You require a database, a complete hosting and one or two coffee cups to deal with the _amazing_ PHP. And Wordpress of Blogspot is too mainstream for you.

Now, with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) you just take care of writing.

Jekyll will generate a full website from just text files. You only need to take care of that simple and easy plain files, and you will get a site like this!

And if you want a them for you blog or site, take a look at [Jekyll Themes](jekyllthemes.org).
