This is a short entry, either for me, to keep this repo on my history forever, as long as this blog lasts. And for anyone interested on a quick and efford-less way to setup an OpenVPN in seconds.

All merits are for [Kylemanna](https://github.com/kylemanna) and it's Docker image, [Docker-OpenVPN](https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn).
