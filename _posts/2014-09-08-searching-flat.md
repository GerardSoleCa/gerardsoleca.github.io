Since I started looking for a shared flat in Barcelona few of them caught my attention. I started sending emails to get in touch with the advertisers, but few of them replied.

Last Friday I went to take a look at a flat near Plaça del Centre, it was too expensive to be an indoor shared room.

So I’m still searching a place to live! :D
